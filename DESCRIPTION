Description: CyCIFData is an ExperimentHub package that serves publicly available
    datasets obtained with cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF). CyCIF is a highly
    multiplexed immuno-fluorescence imaging technology of formalin-fixed,
    paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens mounted on glass slides, the most widely
    used specimens for histopathological diagnosis of cancer and other diseases.
    CyCIF generates up to 60-plex images using an iterative process (a cycle) in
    which conventional low-plex fluorescence images are repeatedly collected from
    the same sample. The scope of the package is to provide CyCIF data for method
    development and analysis.
